We use <strong>pressure-treated 12mm tongue and groove boards</strong> paired with a sturdy <strong>44mm x 44mm frame</strong> for a strong, durable, and long-lasting structure. The <strong>overlapping timber roof</strong> is designed with a sleek <strong>pent shape</strong>, allowing rainwater to effortlessly run off the back—keeping the inside dry and ensuring year-round enjoyment.</p>\n<p>Upgrade your garden today and raise a glass to great times ahead! </p>\n<h4>Design Insights</h4>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"></span> 15 Year Anti Rot Guarantee</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"></span> Pressure treated timber</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"></span> 12mm Tongue and Groove Construction</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"></span> Strong build; 44mm framing for a robust durable structure</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"></span> Made from sustainably sourced timber</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">\n<span class=\"s1\"></span> Manufactured in the UK</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Full Info</h3>\n<p>The Pressure Treated Garden Bar is expertly crafted in the UK using 12mm tongue and groove boards, reinforced with a sturdy 44mm x 44mm frame. This construction method not only ensures durability and strength, but also presents an appealing aesthetic. The roof is made from overlapping timber boards that are securely attached to an internal frame. The modern pent design allows rainwater to easily drain off the back of the bar, keeping the interior dry and preventing any water accumulation.</p>\n<p>The pressure treatment process effectively safeguards the bar against insect damage and natural decay, while maintaining its appearance. Additionally, a 15-year anti-rot guarantee is included, although the bar must be built on a solid, flat base such as concrete or concrete slabs. (The use of waterproof treatment during initial construction and annually thereafter is recommended.)</p>\n<h3>Technical Info</h3>\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong><span> </span>Sizes are approximate only.

This construction method not only ensures durability and strength, but also presents an appealing aesthetic. The roof is made from overlapping timber boards that are securely attached to an internal frame. The modern pent design allows rainwater to easily drain off the back of the bar, keeping the interior dry and preventing any water accumulation.</p>\n<p>The pressure treatment process effectively safeguards the bar against insect damage and natural decay, while maintaining its appearance. Additionally, a 15-year anti-rot guarantee is included, although the bar must be built on a solid, flat base such as concrete or concrete slabs. (The use of waterproof treatment during initial construction and annually thereafter is recommended.)</p>\n<h3>Technical Info</h3>\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong><span> </span>Sizes are approximate only.

Stylish, modern, and full of character, this wooden bar is the perfect way to elevate your outdoor space. Whether you're hosting summer gatherings, weekend get-togethers, or simply unwinding after a long day, this bar will be the heart of the fun.</p>\n<p>Complete with a sturdy wooden countertop for serving up drinks and a convenient side access point, it's designed for effortless entertaining. Just add some bar stools, string up some lights, and stock your favorite beverages to create your very own garden pub. Cheers to good times ahead!</p>\n<h3>Full Info</h3>\n<p>The Pressure Treated Garden Bar is expertly crafted in the UK using 12mm tongue and groove boards, reinforced with a sturdy 44mm x 44mm frame. This construction method not only ensures durability and strength, but also presents an appealing aesthetic. The roof is made from overlapping timber boards that are securely attached to an internal frame. The modern pent design allows rainwater to easily drain off the back of the bar, keeping the interior dry and preventing any water accumulation.</p>\n<p>The pressure treatment process effectively safeguards the bar against insect damage and natural decay, while maintaining its appearance. Additionally, a 15-year anti-rot guarantee is included, although the bar must be built on a solid, flat base such as concrete or concrete slabs. (The use of waterproof treatment during initial construction and annually thereafter is recommended.)</p>\n<h3>Technical Info</h3>\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong><span> </span>Sizes are approximate only.

They can invent stories, role-play different scenarios, and engage in imaginative play, all of which is crucial for cognitive development. Perhaps one day their playhouse will be a spaceship, the next day it’ll be a haven away from flowing lava. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to encouraging cognitive development, playing in a playhouse encourages physical activity and movement. Whether climbing, crawling, or running around, children develop their motor skills and coordination. We have designed our playhouses with this in mind,<span> </span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">featuring a minimum 12mm finger gap around the door, planed and rounded timbers and ventilation holes and safety ladder treads, our playhouses are EN71 certified and UKCA Marked, so you can be sure your little one’s safety is our priority. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playhouses also encourage children out of the house. We live in a world where electronic tablets and on-demand television so easily become the forefront of a child’s free time, giving children space of their own, to virtually use as they please is a sure fire way to minimise the screen time and get them enjoying the great outdoors.</span></p>\n<h3>Technical Info</h3>\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong><span> </span>Sizes are approximate only.

They can invent stories, role-play different scenarios, and engage in imaginative play, all of which is crucial for cognitive development. Perhaps one day their playhouse will be a spaceship, the next day it’ll be a haven away from flowing lava. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to encouraging cognitive development, playing in a playhouse encourages physical activity and movement. Whether climbing, crawling, or running around, children develop their motor skills and coordination. We have designed our playhouses with this in mind,<span> </span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">featuring a minimum 12mm finger gap around the door, planed and rounded timbers and ventilation holes and safety ladder treads, our playhouses are EN71 certified and UKCA Marked, so you can be sure your little one’s safety is our priority. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playhouses also encourage children out of the house. We live in a world where electronic tablets and on-demand television so easily become the forefront of a child’s free time, giving children space of their own, to virtually use as they please is a sure fire way to minimise the screen time and get them enjoying the great outdoors.</span></p>\n<h3>Technical Info</h3>\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong><span> </span>Sizes are approximate only.

Elevated on its own lookout, this playhouse serves as a perfect source of inspiration for imaginative childhood games such as sailing on a pirate ship or spotting dinosaurs from the Jurassic era.</p>\n<p>Made from high-quality Shiplap cladding with interlocking tongue and groove boards, the playhouse offers both durability and an attractive appearance. Both the roof and floor are constructed from sturdy solid sheet board, providing a sturdy surface for everyday play.

They can invent stories, role-play different scenarios, and engage in imaginative play, all of which is crucial for cognitive development. Perhaps one day their playhouse will be a spaceship, the next day it’ll be a haven away from flowing lava. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to encouraging cognitive development, playing in a playhouse encourages physical activity and movement. Whether climbing, crawling, or running around, children develop their motor skills and coordination. We have designed our playhouses with this in mind,<span> </span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">featuring a minimum 12mm finger gap around the door, planed and rounded timbers and ventilation holes and safety ladder treads, our playhouses are EN71 certified and UKCA Marked, so you can be sure your little one’s safety is our priority. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playhouses also encourage children out of the house. We live in a world where electronic tablets and on-demand television so easily become the forefront of a child’s free time, giving children space of their own, to virtually use as they please is a sure fire way to minimise the screen time and get them enjoying the great outdoors.</span></p>\n<h3>Technical Info</h3>\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong><span> </span>Sizes are approximate only.

They can invent stories, role-play different scenarios, and engage in imaginative play, all of which is crucial for cognitive development. Perhaps one day their playhouse will be a spaceship, the next day it’ll be a haven away from flowing lava. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to encouraging cognitive development, playing in a playhouse encourages physical activity and movement. Whether climbing, crawling, or running around, children develop their motor skills and coordination. We have designed our playhouses with this in mind,<span> </span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">featuring a minimum 12mm finger gap around the door, planed and rounded timbers and ventilation holes and safety ladder treads, our playhouses are EN71 certified and UKCA Marked, so you can be sure your little one’s safety is our priority. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Playhouses also encourage children out of the house. We live in a world where electronic tablets and on-demand television so easily become the forefront of a child’s free time, giving children space of their own, to virtually use as they please is a sure fire way to minimise the screen time and get them enjoying the great outdoors.</span></p>\n<h3>Technical Info</h3>\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong><span> </span>Sizes are approximate only.

    "body_html": "<p>Discover infinite opportunities for outdoor fun in your backyard with the Snug Tower Wooden Playhouse with Slide. Let your creativity run wild as you transform this wendy house into a princess palace, fairy sanctuary, or castle lookout. Boasting a raised platform, a ladder, and a slide, this kids' playhouse offers endless adventures for curious little ones.</p>\n<p>Constructed with durable shiplap tongue &amp; groove boards and a sturdy solid sheet board roof and floor, this playhouse provides a secure and durable play space for everyday use.</p>\n<p>All of Mercia's playhouses are designed with safety as the top priority featuring the following safety components: EN71 certification and UKCA marking, a 12mm safety gap to prevent finger trapping, styrene windows (a safer alternative to glass), rounded timbers to prevent splinters, and ladder treads to prevent slipping. Additionally, the playhouse also includes ventilation holes (intended for domestic use only). Suitable for children 36 months and older. </p>\n<p>*Photos for illustrative purposes only.</p>\n<h3>Design Insights  </h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Made in accordance with Toys (Safety) Regulation 2011 (EN71)</li>\n<li>Suitable for Little Ones 3 Years and Older</li>\n<li>10 Year Anti Rot Guarantee</li>\n<li>Planed &amp; Rounded Edges for Safety</li>\n<li>Safety First Shatterproof Windows</li>\n<li>12mm Interlocking Shiplap Tongue &amp; Groove Cladding</li>\n<li>Mineral Roofing Felt Supplied</li>\n<li>Sustainable PEFC Timber</li>\n<li>Handmade in the UK for Superior Quality</li>\n<li>Opt for Professional Home Installation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>Benefits of a Playhouse</b></h3>\n<p><span>A playhouse offers children a creative outlet to explore their imagination. With the freedom to invent stories and act out various scenarios, children can engage in imaginative play, which is essential for cognitive growth. Whether they transform the playhouse into a spaceship or a safe haven from molten lava, children will have endless hours of fun and learning. </span></p>\n<p><span></span>The playhouse not only promotes cognitive development, but also encourages physical activity and movement. Children improve their motor skills and coordination while climbing, crawling, or running around. We have taken this into consideration when designing our playhouses, ensuring a minimum 12mm finger gap around the door, planed and rounded timbers, and ventilation holes. Our playhouses are EN71 certified and UKCA Marked, prioritizing your child's safety.<span></span></p>\n<p><span>In today's society, electronic devices and television tend to dominate a child's free time. To reduce screen time and encourage outdoor activities, providing a dedicated space for children to enjoy is essential. Playhouses offer the perfect solution for children to have their own area to explore and play.</span></p>\n<h3>Full Details</h3>\n<p><b>Sustainable Timber</b></p>\n<p><span>Each playhouse by Mercia is constructed with ethically sourced and certified timber, right here in the UK by their team of highly skilled craftsmen. Mercia recognizes the significance of preserving the planet for future generations, which is why they collaborate with PEFC to ensure that their timber comes from only managed and sustainable forests.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><b>Fixtures and Fittings</b></p>\n<p><span>The product comes equipped with all necessary elements, including strong roofing felt and fixtures, as well as comprehensive instructions and expert recommendations from Mercia, to make assembly an easy and hassle-free process.</span></p>\n<p><b>Treatment Requirements</b></p>\n<p><span>This playhouse comes untreated and will need to be coated with a high-quality timber treatment after installation.</span></p>\n<p><b>Anti-Rot Guarantee </b></p>\n<p><span>Mercia's playhouses are accompanied by a 10-year anti-rot guarantee, ensuring that your children can enjoy their outdoor playtime without any worries. To maintain the validity of the guarantee, it is recommended to annually treat the playhouse with wood treatment to prevent fungal attacks and prolong its lifespan.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Technical Info</span></h3>\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong><span> </span>Sizes are approximate only.

    "body_html": "<p>Inspire your children's imagination with the 5 x 6 Snug Tower Playhouse. This playhouse offers endless possibilities for imaginative play, whether it's a princess tower, country cottage, or beach hut.</p>\n<p>This playhouse is designed to inspire creativity and independence in younger children while fostering their love for outdoor play. It is constructed with sturdy shiplap tongue &amp; groove boards, and features a durable solid sheet board roof and floor, ensuring long-lasting use for everyday play.</p>\n<p>All of Mercia's playhouses are designed with safety as the top priority featuring the following safety components: EN71 certification and UKCA marking, a 12mm safety gap to prevent finger trapping, styrene windows (a safer alternative to glass), rounded timbers to prevent splinters, and ladder treads to prevent slipping. Additionally, the playhouse also includes ventilation holes (intended for domestic use only). Suitable for children 36 months and older. </p>\n<p>*Photos for illustrative purposes only.</p>\n<h3>Design Insights  </h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Made in accordance with Toys (Safety) Regulation 2011 (EN71)</li>\n<li>Suitable for Little Ones 3 Years and Older</li>\n<li>10 Year Anti Rot Guarantee</li>\n<li>Planed &amp; Rounded Edges for Safety</li>\n<li>Safety First Shatterproof Windows</li>\n<li>12mm Interlocking Shiplap Tongue &amp; Groove Cladding</li>\n<li>Mineral Roofing Felt Supplied</li>\n<li>Sustainable PEFC Timber</li>\n<li>Handmade in the UK for Superior Quality</li>\n<li>Opt for Professional Home Installation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>Benefits of a Playhouse</b></h3>\n<p><span>A playhouse offers children a creative outlet to explore their imagination. With the freedom to invent stories and act out various scenarios, children can engage in imaginative play, which is essential for cognitive growth. Whether they transform the playhouse into a spaceship or a safe haven from molten lava, children will have endless hours of fun and learning. </span></p>\n<p><span></span>The playhouse not only promotes cognitive development, but also encourages physical activity and movement. Children improve their motor skills and coordination while climbing, crawling, or running around. We have taken this into consideration when designing our playhouses, ensuring a minimum 12mm finger gap around the door, planed and rounded timbers, and ventilation holes. Our playhouses are EN71 certified and UKCA Marked, prioritizing your child's safety.<span></span></p>\n<p><span>In today's society, electronic devices and television tend to dominate a child's free time. To reduce screen time and encourage outdoor activities, providing a dedicated space for children to enjoy is essential. Playhouses offer the perfect solution for children to have their own area to explore and play.</span></p>\n<h3>Full Details</h3>\n<p><b>Sustainable Timber</b></p>\n<p><span>Each playhouse by Mercia is constructed with ethically sourced and certified timber, right here in the UK by their team of highly skilled craftsmen. Mercia recognizes the significance of preserving the planet for future generations, which is why they collaborate with PEFC to ensure that their timber comes from only managed and sustainable forests.</span><b></b></p>\n<p><b>Fixtures and Fittings</b></p>\n<p><span>The product comes equipped with all necessary elements, including strong roofing felt and fixtures, as well as comprehensive instructions and expert recommendations from Mercia, to make assembly an easy and hassle-free process.</span></p>\n<p><b>Treatment Requirements</b></p>\n<p><span>This playhouse comes untreated and will need to be coated with a high-quality timber treatment after installation.</span></p>\n<p><b>Anti-Rot Guarantee </b></p>\n<p><span>Mercia's playhouses are accompanied by a 10-year anti-rot guarantee, ensuring that your children can enjoy their outdoor playtime without any worries. To maintain the validity of the guarantee, it is recommended to annually treat the playhouse with wood treatment to prevent fungal attacks and prolong its lifespan.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Technical Info</span></h3>\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong><span> </span>Sizes are approximate only.

Its charming Georgian style windows are designed for safety, with secure sash frames and sturdy styrene, giving it a classic Wendy-house appearance that's perfect for imaginative play in the backyard.</p>\n<p>Constructed using high-quality Shiplap cladding, the interlocking tongue and groove boards have a protective lip for a sturdy, weatherproof panel and an aesthetically pleasing appearance. The playhouse's roof and floor are made from durable solid sheet board, perfect for constant use. For added safety, the playhouse is equipped with fixed, strong styrene windows that are shatterproof.</p>\n<h4>Design Insights  </h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Made in accordance with Toys (Safety) Regulation 2011 (EN71)</li>\n<li>Suitable for Little Ones 3 Years and Older</li>\n<li>10 Year Anti Rot Guarantee</li>\n<li>Planed &amp; Rounded Edges for Safety</li>\n<li>Safety First Shatterproof Windows</li>\n<li>12mm Interlocking Shiplap Tongue &amp; Groove Cladding</li>\n<li>Mineral Roofing Felt Supplied</li>\n<li>Sustainable PEFC Timber</li>\n<li>Handmade in the UK for Superior Quality</li>\n<li>Opt for Professional Home Installation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>Benefits of a Playhouse</b></h3>\n<p><span>A playhouse offers children a creative outlet to explore their imagination. With the freedom to invent stories and act out various scenarios, children can engage in imaginative play, which is essential for cognitive growth. Whether they transform the playhouse into a spaceship or a safe haven from molten lava, children will have endless hours of fun and learning. </span></p>\n<p><span></span>The playhouse not only promotes cognitive development, but also encourages physical activity and movement. Children improve their motor skills and coordination while climbing, crawling, or running around. We have taken this into consideration when designing our playhouses, ensuring a minimum 12mm finger gap around the door, planed and rounded timbers, and ventilation holes. Our playhouses are EN71 certified and UKCA Marked, prioritizing your child's safety.<span></span></p>\n<p><span>In today's society, electronic devices and television tend to dominate a child's free time. To reduce screen time and encourage outdoor activities, providing a dedicated space for children to enjoy is essential. Playhouses offer the perfect solution for children to have their own area to explore and play.</span></p>\n<h3>Full Details</h3>\n<p><b>Sustainable Timber</b></p>\n<p><span>Each playhouse by Mercia is constructed with ethically sourced and certified timber, right here in the UK by their team of highly skilled craftsmen.

Cladding serves as the exterior covering of the building. The overlapping boards of overlap cladding provide a traditional and rustic appearance. This design allows for proper drainage and prevents rainwater from reaching your stored items, keeping them dry. While this design offers protection against the rain, it may not be completely airtight, leaving room for potential draughts and moisture.</p>\n<p>Shiplap cladding features multiple timber boards that form a flush panel. The recess at the top of each board aids in water run-off, providing protection against harsh elements. It is not only watertight like overlap cladding, but also airtight, making it ideal for storing items at risk of draughts and dampness. Additionally, its smooth exterior and interior panels create a sleek and sophisticated finish, elevating the look of your garden.</p>\n<h3><span>Technical Info</span></h3>\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<div id=\"spec1\" class=\"specCol\">\n<table class=\"full-width\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Imperial Size (ft)</strong></td>\n<td>6 x 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>People Req'd To Build</strong></td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Anti-Rot Guarantee</strong></td>\n<td>10 Years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cladding Style</strong></td>\n<td>Overlap</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Windowless</strong></td>\n<td>true</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Roof Material</strong></td>\n<td>8mm Solid Sheet Board</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Floor Material</strong></td>\n<td>8mm Solid Sheet Board</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Roof Type</strong></td>\n<td>Apex</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Door Style</strong></td>\n<td>Double Door</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Building Type</strong></td>\n<td>Bike Sheds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Treatment Type</strong></td>\n<td>Dip Treated</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Metric Size (Meters)</strong></td>\n<td>1.8 x 0.9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Under 2.5m Tall</strong></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Material</strong></td>\n<td>Wood</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<div id=\"spec2\" class=\"specCol\">\n<table class=\"full-width\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th><strong>Imperial</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Metric</strong></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Width</strong></td>\n<td>72.0 in</td>\n<td class=\"metric\">1.83 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Depth</strong></td>\n<td>33.97 in</td>\n<td class=\"metric\">0.86 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Eaves Height</strong></td>\n<td>52.75 in</td>\n<td class=\"metric\">1.34 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Ridge Height</strong></td>\n<td>67.5 in</td>\n<td class=\"metric\">1.71 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Door Width</strong></td>\n<td>61.0 in</td>\n<td class=\"metric\">1.55 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Internal Depth</strong></td>\n<td>28.0 in</td>\n<td class=\"metric\">0.71 m</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>",

Automatically added to your order</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Care &amp; Maintenance</strong></h3>\n<p>To become the household expert in wood-fired ovens, it is important to routinely remove ash and debris after each use to maintain proper airflow and efficient heating. A soft brush or scraper can effectively remove soot and food residue from the interior. Prevent cracks by slowly heating the oven with small fires, particularly after extended periods of inactivity. Safeguard the oven from moisture by covering it when not in use and avoiding exposure to rain. Regular inspections for damage or cracks are recommended, and any issues can be addressed with proper refractory materials to extend the oven's lifespan. Replacement parts are also available upon request.</p>\n<h3>3 Year Warranty</h3>\n<p>Alfresco Chef guarantee the wood fired oven and its components to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for up to 3 years.</p>\n<p>Please retain your receipt, invoice or any other proof of purchase for the duration of your ownership and <strong>register your oven online </strong><a href=\"https://www.alfrescochef.co.uk/pages/register\" title=\"‌\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here</strong></a></p>\n<p>In the unlikely event that something does go wrong, we will endeavour to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Repair or replace faulty component parts.</li>\n<li>If the fault cannot be repaired, we will replace the whole oven.</li>\n<li>In the event the oven is replaced, we require the existing oven to be returned.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To make a warranty claim, please contact their customer support team by email <a href=\"mailto:info@thealfrescochef.co.uk\">info@thealfrescochef.co.uk</a>.

important to routinely remove ash and debris after each use to maintain proper airflow and efficient heating.</p>\n<p>A soft brush or scraper can effectively remove soot and food residue from the interior. Prevent cracks by slowly heating the oven with small fires, particularly after extended periods of inactivity. Safeguard the oven from moisture by covering it when not in use and avoiding exposure to rain.</p>\n<p>Regular inspections for damage or cracks are recommended, and any issues can be addressed with proper refractory materials to extend the oven's lifespan. Replacement parts are also available upon request.</p>\n<h3>3 Year Warranty</h3>\n<p>Alfresco Chef guarantee the wood fired oven and its components to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for up to 3 years.</p>\n<p>Please retain your receipt, invoice or any other proof of purchase for the duration of your ownership and <strong>register your oven online </strong><a title=\"‌\" href=\"https://www.alfrescochef.co.uk/pages/register\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here</strong></a></p>\n<p>In the unlikely event that something does go wrong, we will endeavour to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Repair or replace faulty component parts.</li>\n<li>If the fault cannot be repaired, we will replace the whole oven.</li>\n<li>In the event the oven is replaced, we require the existing oven to be returned.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To make a warranty claim, please contact their customer support team by email <a href=\"mailto:info@thealfrescochef.co.uk\">info@thealfrescochef.co.uk</a>.

Automatically added to your order</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Care &amp; Maintenance</strong></h3>\n<p>To become the household expert in wood-fired ovens, it is important to routinely remove ash and debris after each use to maintain proper airflow and efficient heating. A soft brush or scraper can effectively remove soot and food residue from the interior. Prevent cracks by slowly heating the oven with small fires, particularly after extended periods of inactivity. Safeguard the oven from moisture by covering it when not in use and avoiding exposure to rain. Regular inspections for damage or cracks are recommended, and any issues can be addressed with proper refractory materials to extend the oven's lifespan. Replacement parts are also available upon request.</p>\n<h3>3 Year Warranty</h3>\n<p>Alfresco Chef guarantee the wood fired oven and its components to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for up to 3 years.</p>\n<p>Please retain your receipt, invoice or any other proof of purchase for the duration of your ownership and <strong>register your oven online </strong><a href=\"https://www.alfrescochef.co.uk/pages/register\" title=\"‌\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here</strong></a></p>\n<p>In the unlikely event that something does go wrong, we will endeavour to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Repair or replace faulty component parts.</li>\n<li>If the fault cannot be repaired, we will replace the whole oven.</li>\n<li>In the event the oven is replaced, we require the existing oven to be returned.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To make a warranty claim, please contact their customer support team by email <a href=\"mailto:info@thealfrescochef.co.uk\">info@thealfrescochef.co.uk</a>.

It gives would-be chefs, party hosts and their guests the unique experience and flavours of wood fired food.</p>\n<p>The Naples oven is fun, easy to use and highly versatile: it’s great for the pizza enthusiast who wants a fuller flavour, but can also be used to barbecue, bake or roast your specially prepared dishes. With a Naples oven, your food will be packed with delicious wood-fired flavour.</p>\n<p>The Naples oven has been designed to be compact and make best use of space. With a generous footprint, it’s the ideal outdoor oven for households with a garden, but not an abundance of space.</p>\n<p>This multi-purpose oven is built with 5cm ceramic fibre insulation and 3cm thick fire brick floor tiles. That means it can quickly reach a temperature of 400°C within 15 minutes, maintaining its heat consistently so you get great results from your wood fired cooking.</p>\n<p>With clever positioning of the oven door and your kiln dried hardwood fuel, you can use the oven to perform a variety of different cooking methods.<strong></strong></p>\n<p>The oven is super easy to light. The user guide shows you how to get your oven safely and efficiently lit. It’s also really easy to manage and use with an Alfresco Chef pizza peel set.</p>\n<p>Maintenance is really simple too. You can quickly clean your oven by brushing the fire brick tiles down with a stainless steel brush and wiping down the exterior with oven cleaner.</p>\n<p>The oven also comes with a base shelf for wood storage, so you can keep your wood close at hand when using it.</p>\n<p>Your oven comes with a step by step assembly guide, user manual and of course the peace of mind of a three year warranty.</p>\n<h3><span>FREE GIFT</span></h3>\n<p><span>A little thank you from us - </span><span><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Enhance your pizza slicing experience with a free* Alfresco Chef's Stainless Steel Pizza Cutter Wheel.

A soft brush or scraper can effectively remove soot and food residue from the interior. Prevent cracks by slowly heating the oven with small fires, particularly after extended periods of inactivity. Safeguard the oven from moisture by covering it when not in use and avoiding exposure to rain. Regular inspections for damage or cracks are recommended, and any issues can be addressed with proper refractory materials to extend the oven's lifespan. Replacement parts are also available upon request.</p>\n<h3>3 Year Warranty</h3>\n<p>Alfresco Chef guarantee the wood fired oven and its components to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for up to 3 years.</p>\n<p>Please retain your receipt, invoice or any other proof of purchase for the duration of your ownership and <strong>register your oven online </strong><a href=\"https://www.alfrescochef.co.uk/pages/register\" title=\"‌\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here</strong></a></p>\n<p>In the unlikely event that something does go wrong, we will endeavour to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Repair or replace faulty component parts.</li>\n<li>If the fault cannot be repaired, we will replace the whole oven.</li>\n<li>In the event the oven is replaced, we require the existing oven to be returned.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To make a warranty claim, please contact their customer support team by email <a href=\"mailto:info@thealfrescochef.co.uk\">info@thealfrescochef.co.uk</a>.

With a groove at the top of each board, this encourages water run off and ensuring the interior remains dry as well as air tight.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our shiplap sheds come with a tongue and groove roof and floor. Hard-wearing and robust, this flooring will easily withstand daily use, such as being utilised as a workshop, and is the ideal option for storing heavier items. </span></p>\n<p><span>Woodsman sheds from Waltons are manufactured from thick 2\" x 1\" internal framing, meaning your shed will stand sturdy, tall and proud for many years to come. In addition, another added benefit of the Woodsman range is that you're able to upgrade to additional internal frame supports for further strength and longevity. </span><span><b></b></span></p>\n<p><strong>Customisable, Modular Design</strong></p>\n<p><span>Available in multiple sizes, our Woodsman sheds are versatile and customisable. They feature a modular design, allowing you to customise the placement of doors and windows to your liking and garden layout. Whether you prefer the door positioned at the end of the shed or windows lining a single side, anything is possible with a Woodsman from Waltons.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Ready Painted</strong></p>\n<p>Choosing a pre-painted Woodsman shed saves you hours of time and effort. We use premium, fully opaque paint to ensure a durable, low-maintenance finish that protects the building from weather, UV exposure, mold, and fungal growth. To keep it looking its best, we include a 1L tin of paint for any future touch-ups. Simply choose the colour that bests suits your style.</p>\n<p><span><b>Apex Roof</b></span></p>\n<p><span>Featuring a high apex roof-line, you’ll find there is plenty of headroom inside, ideal for storing taller items or utilising your shed as a workshop with plenty of space for spending hours tinkering away.</span></p>\n<p><span><b>All Fixtures and Fittings</b></span></p>\n<p><span>High quality roofing felt is supplied to protect your garden shed from the elements and provide longevity.

With a groove at the top of each board, this encourages water run off and ensuring the interior remains dry as well as air tight.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our shiplap sheds come with a tongue and groove roof and floor. Hard-wearing and robust, this flooring will easily withstand daily use, such as being utilised as a workshop, and is the ideal option for storing heavier items. </span></p>\n<p><span>Woodsman sheds from Waltons are manufactured from thick 2\" x 1\" internal framing, meaning your shed will stand sturdy, tall and proud for many years to come. In addition, another added benefit of the Woodsman range is that you're able to upgrade to additional internal frame supports for further strength and longevity. </span><span><b></b></span></p>\n<p><strong>Customisable, Modular Design</strong></p>\n<p><span>Available in multiple sizes, our Woodsman sheds are versatile and customisable. They feature a modular design, allowing you to customise the placement of doors and windows to your liking and garden layout. Whether you prefer the door positioned at the end of the shed or windows lining a single side, anything is possible with a Woodsman from Waltons.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Ready Painted</strong></p>\n<p>Choosing a pre-painted Woodsman shed saves you hours of time and effort. We use premium, fully opaque paint to ensure a durable, low-maintenance finish that protects the building from weather, UV exposure, mold, and fungal growth.

With a groove at the top of each board, this encourages water run off and ensuring the interior remains dry as well as air tight.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our shiplap sheds come with a tongue and groove roof and floor. Hard-wearing and robust, this flooring will easily withstand daily use, such as being utilised as a workshop, and is the ideal option for storing heavier items. </span></p>\n<p><span>Woodsman sheds from Waltons are manufactured from thick 2\" x 1\" internal framing, meaning your shed will stand sturdy, tall and proud for many years to come. In addition, another added benefit of the Woodsman range is that you're able to upgrade to additional internal frame supports for further strength and longevity. </span><span><b></b></span></p>\n<p><strong>Customisable, Modular Design</strong></p>\n<p><span>Available in multiple sizes, our Woodsman sheds are versatile and customisable. They feature a modular design, allowing you to customise the placement of doors and windows to your liking and garden layout. Whether you prefer the door positioned at the end of the shed or windows lining a single side, anything is possible with a Woodsman from Waltons.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Ready Painted</strong></p>\n<p>Choosing a pre-painted Woodsman shed saves you hours of time and effort. We use premium, fully opaque paint to ensure a durable, low-maintenance finish that protects the building from weather, UV exposure, mold, and fungal growth. To keep it looking its best, we include a 1L tin of paint for any future touch-ups. Simply choose the colour that bests suits your style.</p>\n<p><span><b>Apex Roof</b></span></p>\n<p><span>Featuring a high apex roof-line, you’ll find there is plenty of headroom inside, ideal for storing taller items or utilising your shed as a workshop with plenty of space for spending hours tinkering away.</span></p>\n<p><span><b>All Fixtures and Fittings</b></span></p>\n<p><span>High quality roofing felt is supplied to protect your garden shed from the elements and provide longevity.

With a groove at the top of each board, this encourages water run off and ensuring the interior remains dry as well as air tight.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our shiplap sheds come with a tongue and groove roof and floor. Hard-wearing and robust, this flooring will easily withstand daily use, such as being utilised as a workshop, and is the ideal option for storing heavier items. </span></p>\n<p><span>Woodsman sheds from Waltons are manufactured from thick 2\" x 1\" internal framing, meaning your shed will stand sturdy, tall and proud for many years to come. In addition, another added benefit of the Woodsman range is that you're able to upgrade to additional internal frame supports for further strength and longevity. </span><span><b></b></span></p>\n<p><strong>Customisable, Modular Design</strong></p>\n<p><span>Available in multiple sizes, our Woodsman sheds are versatile and customisable. They feature a modular design, allowing you to customise the placement of doors and windows to your liking and garden layout. Whether you prefer the door positioned at the end of the shed or windows lining a single side, anything is possible with a Woodsman from Waltons.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Ready Painted</strong></p>\n<p>Choosing a pre-painted Woodsman shed saves you hours of time and effort. We use premium, fully opaque paint to ensure a durable, low-maintenance finish that protects the building from weather, UV exposure, mold, and fungal growth.

With a groove at the top of each board, this encourages water run off and ensuring the interior remains dry as well as air tight.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our shiplap sheds come with a tongue and groove roof and floor. Hard-wearing and robust, this flooring will easily withstand daily use, such as being utilised as a workshop, and is the ideal option for storing heavier items. </span></p>\n<p><span>Woodsman sheds from Waltons are manufactured from thick 2\" x 1\" internal framing, meaning your shed will stand sturdy, tall and proud for many years to come. In addition, another added benefit of the Woodsman range is that you're able to upgrade to additional internal frame supports for further strength and longevity. </span><span><b></b></span></p>\n<p><strong>Customisable, Modular Design</strong></p>\n<p><span>Available in multiple sizes, our Woodsman sheds are versatile and customisable. They feature a modular design, allowing you to customise the placement of doors and windows to your liking and garden layout. Whether you prefer the door positioned at the end of the shed or windows lining a single side, anything is possible with a Woodsman from Waltons.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Ready Painted</strong></p>\n<p>Choosing a pre-painted Woodsman shed saves you hours of time and effort. We use premium, fully opaque paint to ensure a durable, low-maintenance finish that protects the building from weather, UV exposure, mold, and fungal growth.

With a groove at the top of each board, this encourages water run off and ensuring the interior remains dry as well as air tight.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our shiplap sheds come with a tongue and groove roof and floor. Hard-wearing and robust, this flooring will easily withstand daily use, such as being utilised as a workshop, and is the ideal option for storing heavier items. </span></p>\n<p><span>Woodsman sheds from Waltons are manufactured from thick 2\" x 1\" internal framing, meaning your shed will stand sturdy, tall and proud for many years to come. In addition, another added benefit of the Woodsman range is that you're able to upgrade to additional internal frame supports for further strength and longevity. </span><span><b></b></span></p>\n<p><strong>Customisable, Modular Design</strong></p>\n<p><span>Available in multiple sizes, our Woodsman sheds are versatile and customisable. They feature a modular design, allowing you to customise the placement of doors and windows to your liking and garden layout. Whether you prefer the door positioned at the end of the shed or windows lining a single side, anything is possible with a Woodsman from Waltons.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Ready Painted</strong></p>\n<p>Choosing a pre-painted Woodsman shed saves you hours of time and effort. We use premium, fully opaque paint to ensure a durable, low-maintenance finish that protects the building from weather, UV exposure, mold, and fungal growth. To keep it looking its best, we include a 1L tin of paint for any future touch-ups. Simply choose the colour that bests suits your style.</p>\n<p><span><b>Pent Roof</b></span></p>\n<p><span>Featuring a contemporary pent roof-line, you can rest knowing the shed's naturally sloped silhouette allows for superior rainwater runoff, ensuring the shed remains dry throughout the British seasons. </span></p>\n<p><span><b>All Fixtures and Fittings</b></span></p>\n<p><span>High quality roofing felt is supplied to protect your garden shed from the elements and provide longevity. In addition to this, all fixtures and fittings are supplied as standard and it also includes our comprehensive product instructions helping you install your new shed as quickly and easily as possible.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Security</strong></p>\n<p>This garden building comes complete with Z-braced doors and upgraded pad bolt giving you peace of mind and protection.</p>\n<h3>Technical Info</h3>\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong><span> </span>Sizes are approximate only.

With a groove at the top of each board, this encourages water run off and ensuring the interior remains dry as well as air tight.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our shiplap sheds come with a tongue and groove roof and floor. Hard-wearing and robust, this flooring will easily withstand daily use, such as being utilised as a workshop, and is the ideal option for storing heavier items. </span></p>\n<p><span>Woodsman sheds from Waltons are manufactured from thick 2\" x 1\" internal framing, meaning your shed will stand sturdy, tall and proud for many years to come. In addition, another added benefit of the Woodsman range is that you're able to upgrade to additional internal frame supports for further strength and longevity. </span><span><b></b></span></p>\n<p><strong>Customisable, Modular Design</strong></p>\n<p><span>Available in multiple sizes, our Woodsman sheds are versatile and customisable. They feature a modular design, allowing you to customise the placement of doors and windows to your liking and garden layout. Whether you prefer the door positioned at the end of the shed or windows lining a single side, anything is possible with a Woodsman from Waltons.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Ready Painted</strong></p>\n<p>Choosing a pre-painted Woodsman shed saves you hours of time and effort. We use premium, fully opaque paint to ensure a durable, low-maintenance finish that protects the building from weather, UV exposure, mold, and fungal growth. To keep it looking its best, we include a 1L tin of paint for any future touch-ups. Simply choose the colour that bests suits your style.</p>\n<p><span><b>Pent Roof</b></span></p>\n<p><span>Featuring a contemporary pent roof-line, you can rest knowing the shed's naturally sloped silhouette allows for superior rainwater runoff, ensuring the shed remains dry throughout the British seasons. </span></p>\n<p><span><b>All Fixtures and Fittings</b></span></p>\n<p><span>High quality roofing felt is supplied to protect your garden shed from the elements and provide longevity. In addition to this, all fixtures and fittings are supplied as standard and it also includes our comprehensive product instructions helping you install your new shed as quickly and easily as possible.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Security</strong></p>\n<p>This garden building comes complete with Z-braced doors and upgraded pad bolt giving you peace of mind and protection.</p>\n<h3>Technical Info</h3>\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong><span> </span>Sizes are approximate only.

With a groove at the top of each board, this encourages water run off and ensuring the interior remains dry as well as air tight.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our shiplap sheds come with a tongue and groove roof and floor. Hard-wearing and robust, this flooring will easily withstand daily use, such as being utilised as a workshop, and is the ideal option for storing heavier items. </span></p>\n<p><span>Woodsman sheds from Waltons are manufactured from thick 2\" x 1\" internal framing, meaning your shed will stand sturdy, tall and proud for many years to come. In addition, another added benefit of the Woodsman range is that you're able to upgrade to additional internal frame supports for further strength and longevity. </span><span><b></b></span></p>\n<p><strong>Customisable, Modular Design</strong></p>\n<p><span>Available in multiple sizes, our Woodsman sheds are versatile and customisable. They feature a modular design, allowing you to customise the placement of doors and windows to your liking and garden layout. Whether you prefer the door positioned at the end of the shed or windows lining a single side, anything is possible with a Woodsman from Waltons.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Ready Painted</strong></p>\n<p>Choosing a pre-painted Woodsman shed saves you hours of time and effort. We use premium, fully opaque paint to ensure a durable, low-maintenance finish that protects the building from weather, UV exposure, mold, and fungal growth. To keep it looking its best, we include a 1L tin of paint for any future touch-ups.

With a groove at the top of each board, this encourages water run off and ensuring the interior remains dry as well as air tight.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our shiplap sheds come with a tongue and groove roof and floor. Hard-wearing and robust, this flooring will easily withstand daily use, such as being utilised as a workshop, and is the ideal option for storing heavier items. </span></p>\n<p><span>Woodsman sheds from Waltons are manufactured from thick 2\" x 1\" internal framing, meaning your shed will stand sturdy, tall and proud for many years to come. In addition, another added benefit of the Woodsman range is that you're able to upgrade to additional internal frame supports for further strength and longevity. </span><span><b></b></span></p>\n<p><strong>Customisable, Modular Design</strong></p>\n<p><span>Available in multiple sizes, our Woodsman sheds are versatile and customisable. They feature a modular design, allowing you to customise the placement of doors and windows to your liking and garden layout. Whether you prefer the door positioned at the end of the shed or windows lining a single side, anything is possible with a Woodsman from Waltons.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Ready Painted</strong></p>\n<p>Choosing a pre-painted Woodsman shed saves you hours of time and effort. We use premium, fully opaque paint to ensure a durable, low-maintenance finish that protects the building from weather, UV exposure, mold, and fungal growth. To keep it looking its best, we include a 1L tin of paint for any future touch-ups. Simply choose the colour that bests suits your style.</p>\n<p><span><b>Pent Roof</b></span></p>\n<p><span>Featuring a contemporary pent roof-line, you can rest knowing the shed's naturally sloped silhouette allows for superior rainwater runoff, ensuring the shed remains dry throughout the British seasons. </span></p>\n<p><span><b>All Fixtures and Fittings</b></span></p>\n<p><span>High quality roofing felt is supplied to protect your garden shed from the elements and provide longevity. In addition to this, all fixtures and fittings are supplied as standard and it also includes our comprehensive product instructions helping you install your new shed as quickly and easily as possible.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Security</strong></p>\n<p>This garden building comes complete with Z-braced doors and upgraded pad bolt giving you peace of mind and protection.</p>\n<h3>Technical Info</h3>\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong><span> </span>Sizes are approximate only.

With a groove at the top of each board, this encourages water run off and ensuring the interior remains dry as well as air tight.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our shiplap sheds come with a tongue and groove roof and floor. Hard-wearing and robust, this flooring will easily withstand daily use, such as being utilised as a workshop, and is the ideal option for storing heavier items. </span></p>\n<p><span>Woodsman sheds from Waltons are manufactured from thick 2\" x 1\" internal framing, meaning your shed will stand sturdy, tall and proud for many years to come. In addition, another added benefit of the Woodsman range is that you're able to upgrade to additional internal frame supports for further strength and longevity. </span><span><b></b></span></p>\n<p><strong>Customisable, Modular Design</strong></p>\n<p><span>Available in multiple sizes, our Woodsman sheds are versatile and customisable. They feature a modular design, allowing you to customise the placement of doors and windows to your liking and garden layout. Whether you prefer the door positioned at the end of the shed or windows lining a single side, anything is possible with a Woodsman from Waltons.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Ready Painted</strong></p>\n<p>Choosing a pre-painted Woodsman shed saves you hours of time and effort. We use premium, fully opaque paint to ensure a durable, low-maintenance finish that protects the building from weather, UV exposure, mold, and fungal growth. To keep it looking its best, we include a 1L tin of paint for any future touch-ups. Simply choose the colour that bests suits your style.</p>\n<p><span><b>Pent Roof</b></span></p>\n<p><span>Featuring a contemporary pent roof-line, you can rest knowing the shed's naturally sloped silhouette allows for superior rainwater runoff, ensuring the shed remains dry throughout the British seasons. </span></p>\n<p><span><b>All Fixtures and Fittings</b></span></p>\n<p><span>High quality roofing felt is supplied to protect your garden shed from the elements and provide longevity. In addition to this, all fixtures and fittings are supplied as standard and it also includes our comprehensive product instructions helping you install your new shed as quickly and easily as possible.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Security</strong></p>\n<p>This garden building comes complete with Z-braced doors and upgraded pad bolt giving you peace of mind and protection.</p>\n<h3>Technical Info</h3>\n<div id=\"specification\">\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong><span> </span>Sizes are approximate only.

The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4.

In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5.

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee.

Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim.

Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable.

Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4.

If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications.

Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4.

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable.

Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5.

In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee.

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee.

Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5.

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

The Agate can be used when you want to highlight a driveway or when the decklights are not sufficient in their light efficiency. Due to its strong light emission, it can be a good solution in situations in which a lot of light is desired. The uplight is available in black and has a stainless steel ring. <br><br>• Powerful light source for highlighting a tree or object <br>• Illuminates up to 3.5 metres</span></p>\n<p><span data-sheets-root=\"1\"><meta charset=\"utf-8\"> <strong>Ready to get started? </strong>Here's your<strong> <a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0827/5866/4539/files/GGC-LP-Brochure-EN-2024.pdf?v=1732868998\" target=\"_blank\">Lightpro Brochure </a>-</strong> Follow<strong> pages 7 &amp; 8 </strong>for your set up guide</span></p>\n<p><img height=\"116\" width=\"284\" src=\"https://lightprotrade.co.uk/img/cms/home/lightpro-system/agate-002_1.jpg\" alt=\"amber-002.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\"></p>\n<p><strong>All Lightpro fittings come with a female connector and a 6 year warranty when used within a complete Lightpro system.</strong></p>\n<p><span data-sheets-root=\"1\"><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0827/5866/4539/files/GCC-lightpro-garden-lighting-system.jpg?v=1730542930\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<h3><span data-sheets-root=\"1\">Technical Info</span></h3>\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-3322893a elementor-column elementor-col-50 elementor-inner-column\" data-id=\"3322893a\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-67d8889d elementor-widget elementor-widget-product-features elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"67d8889d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"product-features.default\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n<table class=\"ce-product-features\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"ce-product-features__row\">\n<th class=\"ce-product-features__label\">Construction</th>\n<td class=\"ce-product-features__value\">Stainless Steel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"ce-product-features__row\">\n<th class=\"ce-product-features__label\">Colour</th>\n<td class=\"ce-product-features__value\">Stainless Steel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"ce-product-features__row\">\n<th class=\"ce-product-features__label\">IP Rating</th>\n<td class=\"ce-product-features__value\">IP67</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"ce-product-features__row\">\n<th class=\"ce-product-features__label\">Cable</th>\n<td class=\"ce-product-features__value\">0.5 metre rubber with connector</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"ce-product-features__row\">\n<th class=\"ce-product-features__label\">Dimensions</th>\n<td class=\"ce-product-features__value\">115 x 115</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"ce-product-features__row\">\n<th class=\"ce-product-features__label\">Weight</th>\n<td class=\"ce-product-features__value\">6193011</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"ce-product-features__row\">\n<th class=\"ce-product-features__label\">Lamp Type</th>\n<td class=\"ce-product-features__value\">MR16 LED non-dimmable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"ce-product-features__row\">\n<th class=\"ce-product-features__label\">Lumen / Colour</th>\n<td class=\"ce-product-features__value\">190 / 300K Warm White</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"ce-product-features__row\">\n<th class=\"ce-product-features__label\">Voltage</th>\n<td class=\"ce-product-features__value\">12V</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"ce-product-features__row\">\n<th class=\"ce-product-features__label\">Mounting Type</th>\n<td class=\"ce-product-features__value\">Ground (70mm cut out)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"ce-product-features__row\">\n<th class=\"ce-product-features__label\">System</th>\n<td class=\"ce-product-features__value\">LightPro</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"ce-product-features__row\">\n<th class=\"ce-product-features__label\">Projected Lamp Lifetime</th>\n<td class=\"ce-product-features__value\">10,000 Hours</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"ce-product-features__row\">\n<th class=\"ce-product-features__label\">Warranty</th>\n<td class=\"ce-product-features__value\">6 Years</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-2590bf74 elementor-column elementor-col-50 elementor-inner-column\" data-id=\"2590bf74\" data-element_type=\"column\">\n<div class=\"elementor-column-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap\">\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-184cb401 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"184cb401\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-184cb401 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"184cb401\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\">\n<h3><br></h3>\n<h3>LightPro Connection System</h3>\n<p>The Lightpro 12V outdoor lighting system is easily installed by anyone.

General</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions are to be read in conjunction with the prevailing General Terms and Conditions for the sale of Techmar lighting products or with any other terms and conditions agreed between Techmar and the buyer.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to these guarantee provisions, the (General) Terms and Conditions of Techmar remain effective and legally valid. In the event of any discrepancies between these guarantee provisions and the (General) terms and conditions relating to the products, the guarantee provisions will prevail.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the conditions and provisos of the guarantee as specified below, Techmar guarantees that the products will be free of defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the terms of these guarantee provisions, a defect (or defective product) means that a product has a material or construction fault that makes it largely impossible for the product to perform in accordance with the agreed specifications. The buyer has a guarantee to the product during the guarantee period subject to the provisions below.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee applies to the LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories. The included light sources are hereby excluded.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period for LightPro outdoor lighting fixtures with accessories comprises 6 years.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies to products working in an ambient temperature of a minimum of -20 C and a maximum of + 50 C.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For end users/consumers, the guarantee period starts on the purchase date, for resale organisations, distributors or dealers, it starts on the delivery date.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee period no longer applies if/in case the specific product properties have been changed by others than those authorised by Techmar, or in case Techmar products are joined or connected to products other than Techmar products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dimming and the application of network-control systems affect the guarantee.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee only applies if the product is used, installed and maintained properly in accordance with our instructions in the product manual, where necessary allowing for the specific tolerances on luminous flux and system power as stated in the accompanying product documentation/manual.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer cannot rely on any other information or documentation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The products must have been purchased directly from Techmar or from a resale organisation, distributor or dealer of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The proof of purchase of the products must be present and available to Techmar. The warranty only applies when a complete Lightpro system is installed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Terms and conditions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee offered by Techmar only applies to the buyer. If the buyer is a reseller, distributor or dealer recognised by Techmar, the product is also covered by the same guarantee. If so requested, the product must be returned by the buyer who appeals to the guarantee within the applicable guarantee period, so that after investigation, Techmar is able to determine whether the product concerned fails to comply with this guarantee. If a product does not perform in accordance with this guarantee, Techmar will provide a replacement for the defective product free of charge, or Techmar will, at its discretion, repair or replace the defective part of the product or refund the purchase price paid to the buyer. If Techmar opts for replacement of the product and it turns out that this is not possible due to the fact that it is no longer produced or not available, Techmar may refund the purchase amount or replace the product with a comparable product (which may slightly differ in design and product specifications).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No representative, distributor or dealer is authorised to replace, change or extend any aspect of the guarantee provisions on behalf of Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee does not apply to damage or non-performance due to force majeure or misuse, improper use, deviant use or use that violates applicable standards, regulations or instructions for use, including but not limited to those adopted in the latest safety, industry and/or electricity standards.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This guarantee is void if repairs or changes to the product are carried out by anyone whomsoever without written permission from Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The purchase or delivery date of the product must be clearly traceable. Techmar reserves the right to make a final decision regarding the validity of any guarantee claim. See also under 5: restrictions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Guarantee claims</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If delivery is carried out in stages (with or without commissioning) the guarantee period for the product concerned does not start on the purchase or delivery date, however on the invoice date, unless otherwise confirmed by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No products are covered by these guarantee provisions if the buyer is in default according to the General Terms and Conditions with regard to his payment obligations.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For entitlement to a valid guarantee claim, the buyer must immediately inform Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) of any alleged defective product before the end of the guarantee period. Further to this, Techmar's obligations under this guarantee are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must have proof of purchase for the Product available for inspection;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The buyer must, immediately and no later than thirty (30) days after discovery, submit claims under this guarantee to Techmar or its representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) and thereby supply at least the following information about the defective product:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- name and/or type number of the product;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- details about the (claimed) defect, including the number of faults;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the applicable purchase, delivery or invoice date and details about the application, location, period of use (estimate of the number of actual burning hours) and anything else that may be needed for Techmar to assess the alleged defect;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- the buyer provides Techmar or Techmar’s representative (resale organisation, distributor or dealer) with the product, with regard to which the buyer appeals to these guarantee provisions, for further analysis if requested;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">- any legal proceedings concerning any guarantee claim must be started within one (1) year after the date of the claim. Any claim that has not been reported or submitted in accordance with the preceding sentence is null and void.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Techmar’s discretion, Techmar's guarantee obligations are limited to either the repair or the delivery of a replacement product of the defective product within a reasonable period of time, or to an appropriate refund of its purchase price.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Repairs, replacements or rectifications do not result in an extension or renewal of the applicable guarantee period. Techmar reserves the right, at its discretion, to replace a defective product covered by the guarantee with a product that slight differs in design and/or product specifications to the extent that the performance of the Product is not affected by it. Techmar may charge the buyer for the reasonable costs it has incurred with respect to an alleged defect or returned product that does not appear to be a defect, including reasonable costs for transport, testing and handling.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. No tacit or other guarantees</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The guarantee and remedies in the terms of the limited guarantee are the only guarantees provided by Techmar with regard to the products, and are provided in lieu of any other guarantees, whether express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of merchantability or suitability for a specific purpose of use, which guarantees are hereby rejected.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These guarantee provisions state the full liability and obligation of Techmar in respect of the buyer and are the sole and exclusive remedy of the buyer in relation to defective or non-compliant products supplied by Techmar to the Buyer, regardless of whether the damage is based on a guarantee that is not explicitly mentioned in these terms and conditions, an unlawful act, a contract or other legal theory, even if Techmar has been informed or Techmar is aware of these defects.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Restrictions</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar does not guarantee whether or not products infringe any patent, trademark, copyright, design right or other right to the intellectual property of third parties, and with regard to any right of third parties, Techmar only transfers such rights to the extent Techmar holds such rights in respect of the buyer, provided that Techmar guarantees that it was not actually (or not reasonably) aware of such an infringement at the time of acceptance of the buyer's order.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Techmar has no guarantee obligations if it appears that an alleged defect has occurred as a result of the following:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any form of force majeure or natural disaster. In the event and to the extent force majeure is not defined in the General Terms and Conditions, force majeure means and includes any circumstance or incident that is reasonably beyond Techmar’s control - whether or not these could be anticipated at the time of the agreement was concluded - and as a result of which Techmar cannot be required to fulfil its obligations, including force majeure or default on the part of Techmar’s suppliers.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Condition of the electrical supply including current peaks, over/undervoltage and ripple currents on control systems exceeding the specified limits of the product and that are established by relevant power standards (e.g. EN 50160 standards).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Incorrect wiring, installation or maintenance of products not carried out by (or for) Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to comply with the Instructions or guidelines imposed by Techmar for the installation, operation, application, maintenance or environment or any other document that comes with the products or with the applicable safety, industry, and/or electricity standards or rules:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Failure to use the products for the purposes for which they were designed.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exposure to excessive wear, lightning, neglect, negligence, accidents, misuse, abuse, improper or abnormal use of the products.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any attempt to repair, change or alteration not approved in writing by Techmar.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use of LED products without allowance for the application instructions with regard to possible contamination or cleaning.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Two doors provide easy access, and a small doorway connects the sheltered area and run for unrestricted movement. The galvanised mesh in the front adds to the longevity of the building, while the 28mm x 28mm interior framing and mineral roof felt provide protection against harsh weather.</p>\n<p>The floor tiles are removable for easy cleaning, and a drain hole prevents water build-up. Plus, with a ten year anti rot guarantee, our sustainably sourced and UK-made product will provide peace of mind for years to come.

Available in three spacious designs, and complete with a tall reverse apex roof which provides lots of headroom, the Welbeck is a stylish and practical choice for your home or business office space.</p>\n<p>At 6ft tall from the bottom of the gables, this Garden Office cabin is designed to be accommodating. The interior space is spacious and able to be easily divided. With the bigger sizes this is even incorporated into the design, with two internal rooms separated by a partition wall to create individual workspaces.</p>\n<p>While the Welbeck is designed to be used as a Garden Office, there’s really no limit to how you can use it. Utilise the internal area as a home gym, art or crafts studio, hobby room, and more - with this much space, there’s no limit to what you can do with it!</p>\n<p>The reverse apex roof provides a traditional character to the building, which works in conjunction with the modern-styled windows to create a balanced aesthetic. The windows and glazed doors are large and wide, allowing in large amounts of natural light, but are robust and secure thanks to the double-glazed toughened glass.</p>\n<p>We’ve designed this garden office with 44mm interlocking wood panels, which provide a strong and durable construction. The floor and roof are also built to be strong and are made of 19mm tongue-and-groove panels of the same design. We then top the roof with a protective green mineral felt. The Welbeck also comes complete with an in-built mortice locking system, ensuring that your belongings are kept safe and secure.</p>\n<p>There’s no installation service necessary with this Log Cabin. The Welbeck is built to be constructed, by hand, by at least two people. You’ll be surprised by just how easy and fast it is to make!</p>\n<h3>Technical Info</h3>\n<div class=\"tech-scroll-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"tech-scroll\">\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tbl-spec\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"dimension-group-Dimensions text-center\">Dimensions</th>\n<th class=\"dimension-group-3.0m text-center\" data-option-id=\"36890\"></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Width</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">418cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Depth</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">319cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Eaves Height (Inc Floor)</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">202.7cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ridge Height (Inc Floor)</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">249cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Width (Internal)</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">383.4cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Depth (Internal)</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">263.4cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><small><b>Please Note:</b><span> </span>This product has been designed as an affordable solution to most popular light domestic uses.

With a separate indoor room and storage space combined into a single structure, you’re getting a cabin, shed, and summerhouse in one fantastic package! </p>\n<p>A robust, secure building is assured with the Darton. Crafted from 28mm interlocking tongue and groove log cladding boards, with panels of the same design for the roof and floor, the building can effortlessly stand up to turbulent weather. Extra protection is afforded by the mineral felt roof covering. Even the glazed doors, which let natural light stream indoors, are made from high-strength SAN styrene glazing.</p>\n<p>For additional protection and longevity, you can choose to have your Darton cabin pressure-treated. This involves injecting the wood with a chemical preservative which protects against water ingress and ensures the wood remains continually strong.</p>\n<p>With the Darton, you’ve got free range to furnish and use the dual spaces as you see fit, while having them connected opens up possibilities other cabins just don’t have. </p>\n<p>Go down the classic route and utilise each space for a separate purpose - use the indoor room for a relaxing lounge while the storage unit holds your garden furniture. Or use them in a connected way - such as a small design studio and an accompanying workshop. The possibilities are endless.</p>\n<p>The side storage unit is divided from the indoor room by a partition wall. This wall is adjustable and allows the storage to be either increased or decreased in size depending on your needs and preferences, giving you amazing versatility with the building and how you use it. The cabin itself comes in two sizes, either 12x8ft or 14x8ft, allowing you to choose a model that fits your preferences.</p>\n<p>There’s no installation service needed as the Darton is designed to be built by hand. With at least two people working together, the Darton can be assembled easily and quicker than you would think!</p>\n<h3>Technical Info</h3>\n<div class=\"tech-scroll-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"tech-scroll\">\n<table class=\"tbl-spec\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"dimension-group-Dimensions text-center\">Dimensions</th>\n<th data-option-id=\"36893\" class=\"dimension-group-8ft text-center\">12ft x 8ft</th>\n<th data-option-id=\"36894\" class=\"dimension-group-8ft text-center\">14ft x 8ft</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Width</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">361cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">421cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Depth</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">241cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">241cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Eaves Height (Inc Floor)</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">184cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">185cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Eaves Height (Excl Floor)</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">182cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">182c</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ridge Height (Inc Floor)</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">210cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">210cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ridge Height (Excl Floor)</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">207cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">207cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Door Opening Size (w x h)</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">173cx 149</span></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Minimum Base Width</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">360cm</span></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Minimum Base Length</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">238cm</span></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><small><b>Please Note:</b><span> </span>This product has been designed as an affordable solution to most popular light domestic uses.

And don't just take our word for it - this revolutionary shed is the top choice for many satisfied customers. Keep in mind that the measurements given for the models are based on the roof dimensions, so be sure to check the exact measurements for the precise building dimensions. Also, don't forget to follow our instructions for preparing a solid base for your new shed before it is delivered.\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Base Requirements</strong></h3>\n<p>All steel sheds must be anchored to a firm foundation to protect against wind damage.<br>We can supply a Timber base or a Foundation Kit, which you can purchase with your product.<br>Should I buy a timber base or a foundation kit for my metal shed? What’s the difference?<br>All shed bases should be constructed on level ground with a damp proof membrane.</p>\n<p>The timber base allows you to construct a wooden floor (using the instructions provided), place it on your level ground over your damp-proof membrane and attach the shed to it. This is a quick, simple and cost-effective solution to a garden shed base.<br><br>A foundation kit forms a steel grid over your damp-proof membrane, allowing you either to fill it with concrete or cover it with marine ply to create an internal floor.</p>\n<p>Both base options are ideal for steel buildings, however, if you have an existing concrete or slab base with a damp-proof membrane, you will not require either option</p>\n<h3>Technical Info</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 84.4687%;\" class=\"tbl-spec\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 62.4041%;\" class=\"dimension-group-Dimensions text-center\">Dimensions</th>\n<th style=\"width: 37.5959%;\" data-option-id=\"30869\" class=\"text-center\"></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 62.4041%;\">Width</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.5959%;\"><span class=\"met\">171cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 62.4041%;\">Depth</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.5959%;\"><span class=\"met\">113cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 62.4041%;\">Eaves Height (Inc Floor)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.5959%;\"><span class=\"met\">123cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 62.4041%;\">Ridge Height (Inc Floor)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.5959%;\"><span class=\"met\">142cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 62.4041%;\">Door Opening Size (w x h)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.5959%;\"><span class=\"met\">114 cm x 63cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 62.4041%;\">Door Height</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.5959%;\"><span class=\"met\">114 cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 62.4041%;\">Door Width</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.5959%;\"><span class=\"met\">63cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 62.4041%;\" class=\"dimension-group-Features text-center\">Features</th>\n<th style=\"width: 37.5959%;\" data-option-id=\"30869\" class=\"text-center\"></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 62.4041%;\">Shed Colour</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.5959%;\"><span class=\"met\">Green</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 62.4041%;\">Material</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.5959%;\"><span class=\"met\">Metal</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 62.4041%;\">Roof Style</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.5959%;\"><span class=\"met\">Pent</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><b>Please Note:</b><span> All products supplied self assembly flat packed unless otherwise stated.</span></p>\n</div>",

This top-quality product is the result of two years of extensive research and development, by a team with years of experience in producing quality light-clad metal sheds.</div>\n<div class=\"demensions-new\"><br></div>\n<div class=\"demensions-new\">The combination of modern steel roll forming equipment and expert knowledge has resulted in a shed that is not only stronger and more durable, but also comes in a classic color scheme. This revolutionary achievement offers a lightweight metal shed at an unbeatable price. It is ideal for caravan parks where non-combustible storage is required, providing a rust-free, long-lasting solution with a minimum warranty of 15 years.</div>\n<div class=\"demensions-new\"><br></div>\n<div class=\"demensions-new\">These high-specification garden sheds set the bar for lightweight metal sheds on the market. The 0.3mm steel and ventilated gables make them a superior choice. The frame and base rails are made from heavy gauge galvanized steel, and the assembly process is simple and straightforward. The door\n<p> </p>\n<h3><strong>Base Requirements</strong></h3>\n<p>All steel sheds must be anchored to a firm foundation to protect against wind damage.<br>We can supply a Timber base or a Foundation Kit, which you can purchase with your product.</p>\n<h4>Should I buy a timber base or a foundation kit for my metal shed? What’s the difference?<br>\n</h4>\n<p>All shed bases should be constructed on level ground with a damp-proof membrane.<br>The timber base allows you to construct a wooden floor (using the instructions provided), place it on your level ground over your damp-proof membrane and attach the shed to it. This is a quick, simple and cost-effective solution to a garden shed base.<br>A foundation kit forms a steel grid over your damp-proof membrane, allowing you either to fill with concrete or cover it with marine ply to create an internal floor.<br>Both base options are ideal for steel buildings, however, if you have an existing concrete or slab base with a damp-proof membrane, you will not require either option.</p>\n<h3>Technical Info</h3>\n<table class=\"tbl-spec\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"dimension-group-Dimensions text-center\">Dimensions</th>\n<th

    "body_html": "<p>The Globel Pent Metal Shed is a premium pent roof shed manufactured from high-tensile, hot-dipped galvanised steel. This fantastic metal shed is rust-resistant, robust, durable, and easy to build! Plus, it comes in a timeless anthracite grey or heritage green finish, making the Globel Pent as stylish as it is sturdy.</p>\n<h3>Design insights</h3>\n<div class=\"demensions-new\">\n<ul>\n<li>Lightweight metal garden shed</li>\n<li>High grade 0.3mm steel and paint finish</li>\n<li>Ventilated gables</li>\n<li>Heavy-gauge galvanised steel</li>\n<li>Glide &amp; track door</li>\n<li>Limited Manufacturer's 15 Year Warranty</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Full Details</h3>\n<p><strong><span>Globel Pent Metal Shed</span></strong></p>\n<p>The Globel Pent fronted premium garden shed is a pent roof shed manufactured from high tensile, hot-dipped galvanised steel throughout. This product is the final result of two years of research and development by those who have been involved with light-clad metal sheds for many years.</p>\n<p>A combined effort between a factory with brand new steel roll forming equipment and a research team has now produced a shed which is stronger, more durable and easier to build but remains in a traditional colour combination. This is development in light-clad metal sheds at the best value price.</p>\n<p>Globel sheds are perfect for caravan parks where non-combustible storage sheds are compulsory and will provide a rust-free, practical storage solution for a minimum warranty period of 15 years. These products are the highest specification lightweight metal garden sheds on the market.</p>\n<p>Apart from the high grade of 0.3mm steel and paint finish, they have ventilated gables and all standard buildings have the tallest wall height available. The frame and base rails are made from solid heavy gauge galvanised steel, the parts and their fixings are simple and straightforward to assemble.</p>\n<p>Each door, the door glide &amp; track layout have been designed with strength and simplicity in mind. The door glide itself has been completely redesigned to provide a more stable and well-balanced door opening, providing you with a high-quality range of metal sheds.</p>\n<p>This Globel Pent metal shed is a secure metal storage shed, perfect for keeping your garden tools inside. The galvanised steel ensures the shed is weather resistant, meaning this metal building is extra strong. Since this she is available in a range of sizes too, you're bound to find a shed that fits your needs.</p>\n<p>A huge effort has gone into the preparation of the instruction manual to ensure that it is as ‘user friendly’ and as informative as possible. Our suppliers have sought input and advice from many trusted sources, enabling them to compile a manual which helps to ensure the assembly is more of a pleasure than a chore!!</p>\n<p>Nominal model sizes are based on the roof dimensions.<br>Please refer to the exact measurements for the precise building dimensions.<br>Full details on preparing a base for all buildings will be sent before the unit is delivered.</p>\n<h3><strong>Base Requirements</strong></h3>\n<p>All steel sheds must be anchored to a firm foundation to protect against wind damage.<br>We can supply a Timber base or a Foundation Kit, which you can purchase with your product.</p>\n<h4>Should I buy a timber base or a foundation kit for my metal shed? What’s the difference?</h4>\n<p>All shed bases should be constructed on level ground with a damp-proof membrane.<br>The timber base allows you to construct a wooden floor (using the instructions provided), place it on your level ground over your damp-proof membrane and attach the shed to it. This is a quick, simple and cost-effective solution to a garden shed base.<br>A foundation kit forms a steel grid over your damp-proof membrane, allowing you either to fill it with concrete or cover it with marine ply to create an internal floor.<br>Both base options are ideal for steel buildings, however, if you have an existing concrete or slab base with a damp-proof membrane, you will not require either option.</p>\n<h3>Technical Info</h3>\n<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tbl-spec\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"dimension-group-Dimensions text-center\">Dimensions</th>\n<th class=\"text-center\" data-option-id=\"30862\">5x3</th>\n<th class=\"text-center\" data-option-id=\"32271\">6x3</th>\n<th class=\"text-center\" data-option-id=\"30860\">6x4</th>\n<th class=\"text-center\" data-option-id=\"32270\">8x4</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Width</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">140cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">171cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">171cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">234cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Depth</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">82cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">82cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">113cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">114cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Eaves Height (Inc Floor)</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">179cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">179cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">179cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">180cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ridge Height (Inc Floor)</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">194cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">194cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">198cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">199cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Door Opening Size (w x h)</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">169cm x 58cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">64cm x 169cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">170cm x 63cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">105cm x 170cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Door Height</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">169cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">169cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">169cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">170cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Door Width</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">58cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">64cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">63cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">105cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Width (Internal)</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Base Width</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">140cm</span></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">171cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">233.5cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Base Depth</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">82cm</span></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">113cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">113.5cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Height</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">198cm</span></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">198cm</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">198cm</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th class=\"dimension-group-Features text-center\">Features</th>\n<th class=\"text-center\" data-option-id=\"30862\">5x3</th>\n<th class=\"text-center\" data-option-id=\"32271\">6x3</th>\n<th class=\"text-center\" data-option-id=\"30860\">6x4</th>\n<th class=\"text-center\" data-option-id=\"32270\">8x4</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weight</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">g</span></td>\n<td></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">g</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">g</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Material</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">Metal</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">Metal</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">Metal</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">Metal</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Roof Style</td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">Pent</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">Pent</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">Pent</span></td>\n<td><span class=\"met\">Pent</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><meta charset=\"utf-8\"><b>Please Note:</b><span> All products supplied self assembly flat packed unless otherwise stated.</span></p>\n</div>",

    "body_html": "<p> </p>\n<p>This Polycarbonate Lean-To Greenhouse is expertly designed to withstand even the most extreme weather conditions, providing a long-lasting and secure environment for your plants. The durable aluminium frame and rust-proof base ensure exceptional strength and stability.

Additionally, the shatterproof polycarbonate glazing enhances the structural durability and safety of the greenhouse, reducing the risk of panel damage. The convenient sliding door prevents slamming in strong winds, preserving the integrity of the greenhouse and minimizing potential damage.</p>\n<p>With low-maintenance, UV-protected materials, this Polycarbonate Lean-To greenhouse offers hassle-free gardening solutions that require minimal upkeep.
